%Abstract: A brief summary of the research paper, typically around 150-250 words, highlighting the research question, methods, key findings, and conclusions.
Dwarves: Gem Chase is a board game for two to six players. The game takes place on a mountain where greedy dwarves fight to become the wealthiest dwarf of them all. The mountain is scattered with gemstones of great value, and a golden dragon egg at the very tip of the mountain. All gemstones are placed on the map and picked up during the game.

At the beginning of each game, each player chooses a colour and a courner to be their home base and places their coloured player pieces (dwarves) there. They will also receive a secret mission card. Players take turns moving their game pieces and collecting gemstones. If the dragon egg is collected and brought back to a dwarf's home base, the game ends. To pick up the dragon egg, a player must first possess a minimum of three gemstones. If all the gemstones are picked up, the game ends. The game also ends if a player completes their secret mission.

The winner is the player with the most gemstones when the game ends, alternatively the player who has completed their secret mission.
