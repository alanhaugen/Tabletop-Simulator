up per turn.
Players with three gems in
their ship can pick up the
dragon egg in the middle of
the board and carry it with
a dwarf by moving a dwarf
to it.

A dwarf landing on another
team's dwarf sends the 
enemy dwarf back to their
home base and you can
steal one gem for 0 action
points from the other player.
By landing on a dwarf holding
the dragon egg, you can choose
to simply send the enemy dwarf
back to their home base, or to
also take the dragon egg
with you, carried by your dwarf.
The dragon egg is worth 10
gems. It has to be in your home
base to count towards your
score.
A dwarf carrying the dragon egg
can only move two spaces per
turn.
